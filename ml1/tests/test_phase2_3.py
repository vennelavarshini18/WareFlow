"""
ML1 Phase 2+3 Validation — Curriculum, Rewards & Obstacles
=============================================================
Tests:
1. Reward correctness: moving closer gives positive reward, away gives negative
2. Collision penalty fires correctly (-10, episode ends)
3. Goal reward fires correctly (+100, episode ends)
4. Wall bounce gives -1, agent stays in place
5. Curriculum auto-advances from Stage 1 -> Stage 2 at 90% success
6. Stage 2 spawns all 3 obstacle types
7. Patrol obstacles move along their paths
8. RandomWalk obstacles actually change position
9. Post-move collision (obstacle walks into agent) detected
10. get_state() is consistent across stages
11. Full 5000-step stress test across curriculum transitions
